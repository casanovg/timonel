This is a generic "main" to be used with
usitwislave, it allows to receive various
commands (see commands file) (mostly one
byte) and have various inputs, outputs,
counters, pwm's and adc's to be controlled.

Have a look a ioport.h and ioport.c on
how to link the ioports on your device
to the various commands.
